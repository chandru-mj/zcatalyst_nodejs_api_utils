This repository contains a collection of functions for interacting with Zoho Catalyst, a serverless platform. These functions cover common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and user management tasks using [Zoho Catalyst NodeJs SDK](https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/en/sdk/nodejs/v2/overview/).

### 🚀 Features

- **ZCQL Query Execution**: Run ZCQL queries and fetch data from Catalyst datastore.
- **Record Counting**: Get the count of records in a table with optional filtering.
- **Row Insertion**: Insert single or multiple rows into a specified table.
- **Row Deletion**: Delete single or multiple rows from a specified table.
- **Row Retrieval**: Fetch specific rows or paginated data from a table.
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and delete files from Catalyst's file store.
- **User Management**: Register, enable, disable, and delete end users in the Catalyst platform.

### ⚙️ Dependencies

Download the file **catalystDBFunctions.js and store it in your function to access the methods

Then install the dependencies in your ${function-name} directory:

```bash
npm install lodash
npm install zcatalyst-sdk-node
```

### 📝 Usage

You can import and use these functions in your Node.js application:
```javascript
// Initialize Zoho Catalyst Project
cosnt app = catalyst.initialize(req);
```
```javascript
// Import functions util file
const catalystFunctions =  require('./catalystDBFunctions');
```

```javascript
// Example usage: Execute a ZCQL query
catalystFunctions.ZCQL(app, 'SELECT * FROM table_name')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Error executing query:', err);
  });
```
